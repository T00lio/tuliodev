            Dedicated and skilled web developer with a strong foundation in
            HTML, CSS, Javascript and React, backed by a diverse professional
            background, including CDL truck driving and Financial analysis
            roles. Originally from Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª , move the United States in 2017
            and had the pleasure of visiting all 48 states as a truck driver. On
            my free time I code and play drums which is simmilar to programming,
            which led me to persue a career in web development as a technology
            enthusiast. I am a team player, a fast learner, and I am always
            looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.
